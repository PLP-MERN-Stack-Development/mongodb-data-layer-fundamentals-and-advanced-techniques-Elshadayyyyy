- `insert_books.js` → inserts sample books  
- `find_books.js` → contains find queries  
- `update_books.js` → contains update queries  
- `delete_books.js` → contains delete queries  
- `aggregate_books.js` → contains aggregation pipelines  
- `index_books.js` → creates indexes and demonstrates performance

node find_books.js
node update_books.js
